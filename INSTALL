## Installation

On windows ensure a python interpreter is installed.
For example installing from https://www.python.org/downloads/
will put the py launcher and pip in the PATH.

Then ensure the iniparse module is installed by
running the following from a "cmd" prompt:

```
pip install iniparse
```

Then crudini can be invoked by downloading just the crudini.py
file and running like:

```
py crudini.py --help
```

On Linux systems crudini is generally available from your standard
package manager, and installing will also ensure the iniparse
dependency is appropriately installed on your system.
You can also download and run the single crudini.py file directly
to use latest version.
